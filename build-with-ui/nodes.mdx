# Nodes Overview

Nodes are the **building blocks** of every workflow in DotPortion.

Each node performs a **single, focused responsibility**, and workflows are created by connecting nodes together in sequence.\
This approach makes backend logic **visual, predictable, and easy to maintain**.

This page gives you a **high-level overview of all nodes** available in DotPortion.\
Click on any node to view its **detailed documentation**.

---

## How Nodes Work Together

A typical workflow looks like this:

```

API Start → Request Parameters → Logic → Database → API Response

```

- Execution flows **top to bottom**
- Data flows **between nodes**
- The workflow ends when an **API Response Node** is executed

---

## Core Nodes

### 🔹 API Start Node
**Entry point of every workflow**

Defines how an HTTP request enters DotPortion.

- HTTP Method
- URL Path
- Request entry

👉 [Read API Start Node docs](/docs/nodes/api-start)

---

### 🔹 API Response Node
**Ends the workflow and sends the response**

Controls the final HTTP status and response body.

- Status codes
- Response output
- Terminates execution

👉 [Read API Response Node docs](/docs/nodes/api-response)

---

## Input & Validation Nodes

### 🔹 Request Parameters Node
**Extract and validate incoming request data**

Used to define what input your API expects.

- Body
- Query
- Headers
- Path params

👉 [Read Request Parameters Node docs](/docs/nodes/request-parameters)

---

## Logic & Flow Control Nodes

### 🔹 Condition Node
**Control execution using conditions**

Allows workflows to branch based on JavaScript expressions.

- Boolean conditions
- Access dynamic values
- Guard logic

👉 [Read Condition Node docs](/docs/nodes/condition)

---

### 🔹 Logic Node
**Write custom JavaScript / TypeScript**

Used when visual configuration is not enough.

- Transform data
- Perform calculations
- Build objects

👉 [Read Logic Node docs](/docs/nodes/logic)

---

### 🔹 Loop Node
**Iterate over lists**

Executes connected nodes for each item in an array.

- Sequential execution
- Access current item
- Bulk operations

👉 [Read Loop Node docs](/docs/nodes/loop)

---

## Authentication & Security Nodes

### 🔹 JWT Generate Node
**Generate JSON Web Tokens**

Used for authentication and session handling.

- Custom payload
- Token expiration
- Platform-managed secret

👉 [Read JWT Generate Node docs](/docs/nodes/jwt-generate)

---

### 🔹 JWT Verify Node
**Verify and decode JWTs**

Protects APIs by validating tokens.

- Signature verification
- Expiration checks
- Payload decoding

👉 [Read JWT Verify Node docs](/docs/nodes/jwt-verify)

---

## Database Nodes

### 🔹 Database Node (Managed)
**DotPortion’s built-in database**

No setup required. Ideal for MVPs and rapid development.

- CRUD operations
- Managed MongoDB
- Project-scoped data

👉 [Read Database Node docs](/docs/nodes/database)

---

### 🔹 MongoDB Node (External)
**Connect your own MongoDB database**

Used when working with existing or external databases.

- Requires MongoDB connection URL
- Full CRUD support
- External data access

👉 [Read MongoDB Node docs](/docs/nodes/mongodb)

---

## Choosing the Right Nodes

| Goal | Recommended Nodes |
|----|------------------|
| Build an API | API Start → Response |
| Validate input | Request Parameters |
| Apply logic | Condition / Logic |
| Process arrays | Loop |
| Store data | Database / MongoDB |
| Secure APIs | JWT Verify |
| Generate tokens | JWT Generate |

---

## Best Practices

- Start every workflow with **API Start**
- End every API workflow with **API Response**
- Validate inputs early
- Keep logic nodes focused
- Prefer managed Database Node for quick builds
- Use MongoDB Node for existing databases

---

## What’s Next?

- Learn how each node works in detail
- Build complete API examples
- Combine nodes to create real-world workflows

➡️ Start by reading the **API Start Node** documentation.
