# CORS Configuration

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) controls **which websites are allowed to call your APIs from a browser**.

In DotPortion, CORS is configured **at the project level** and applies to all deployed workflows within the project.

---

## What Is CORS?

Browsers enforce a security rule called the **Same-Origin Policy**, which blocks frontend applications from calling APIs hosted on a different domain unless explicitly allowed.

CORS lets your API say:

> “These origins, methods, and headers are allowed to access me from a browser.”

⚠️ **CORS only affects browser-based requests**\
It does **not** apply to:

- Server-to-server calls
- Mobile apps
- Backend scripts

---

## Configuration UI

> 📷 **CORS Configuration Form**

![CORS Configuration Form](/images/settings/cors-form.png)

This form allows you to enable or disable CORS and define exactly what is allowed.

---

## Enable / Disable CORS

### CORS Toggle

- **Disabled** (default):\
  No CORS headers are sent. Browser-based apps will be blocked.
- **Enabled**:\
  DotPortion adds appropriate CORS headers to API responses.

💡 Enable CORS only if your API is consumed directly from a browser.

---

## Configuration Fields

### Allowed Origins

**Purpose:**\
Defines which domains are allowed to call your API from a browser.

**Format:**\
Comma-separated list of origins.

**Examples:**

```text
https://example.com
```

```text
https://app.example.com, https://admin.example.com
```

```text
*
```

#### Notes

- `*` allows **any origin** (not recommended for production)
- Origins must include protocol (`https://`)
- Wildcards should be used cautiously

### Allowed Methods

**Purpose:**\
Specifies which HTTP methods are allowed for cross-origin requests.

**Example:**

```
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
```

Only these methods will be accepted during browser preflight checks.

### Allowed Headers

**Purpose:**\
Defines which request headers the browser is allowed to send.

**Common examples:**

```
Content-Type, Authorization
```

Add custom headers here if your frontend sends them.

## How CORS Works in DotPortion

When CORS is enabled:

1. Browser sends a **preflight (OPTIONS)** request
2. DotPortion validates:
   - Origin
   - Method
   - Headers
3. If allowed, proper CORS headers are returned
4. Browser allows the actual request

This process is handled automatically by DotPortion.

## Example Use Cases

### Public Frontend App

```
Allowed Origins: https://app.myproduct.com
Allowed Methods: GET, POST
Allowed Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
```

### Local Development

```
Allowed Origins: http://localhost:3000
Allowed Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Allowed Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
```

## Security Best Practices

- Avoid using `*` in production
- Restrict origins to known domains
- Allow only required methods
- Keep headers minimal
- Use authentication in addition to CORS

CORS is **not an authentication mechanism** — it only controls browser access.

## Important Notes

- Changes to CORS settings require saving the configuration
- Updates apply to all deployed workflows
- Misconfigured CORS may cause browser errors like:
  - `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`
