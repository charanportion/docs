# Workflows

A **workflow** is the core building block in DotPortion.\
It represents **how an API request is processed from start to finish** using connected nodes.

Instead of writing code, you design the flow visually — each node performs a single responsibility, and data flows between them automatically.

---

## What Is a Workflow?

In DotPortion, a workflow is:

- A **request-driven execution graph**
- Triggered by an incoming HTTP request
- Composed of connected nodes
- Executed step-by-step in a deterministic order
- Deployed as a live API endpoint

If you’ve used backend frameworks before, think of a workflow as a **controller + service + middleware pipeline**, but visual.

---

## Workflow Structure

Every workflow follows the same high-level structure:

1. **API Start Node**\
   Defines the HTTP method and path
2. **Processing Nodes**\
   Handle validation, logic, database access, authentication, etc.
3. **Response Node**\
   Returns the final HTTP response

---

## Example Workflow

**Use case:** Create a user

```text
API Start (POST /users)
   ↓
Parameter Validation
   ↓
Logic (sanitize input)
   ↓
Database Insert
   ↓
Response (201 Created)
```

Each step is explicit, inspectable, and debuggable.

## How Workflows Execute

When a request hits a deployed workflow:

1. DotPortion matches the **method and path**
2. Execution starts at the **API Start Node**
3. Nodes run **in the order they are connected**
4. Each node receives:
   - Input from the request
   - Output from previous nodes
5. Execution stops when a **Response Node** is reached

If any node fails, execution stops immediately and an error is returned.

---

## Data Flow Between Nodes

Data is passed between nodes as **structured JSON**.

Each node:

- Receives input
- Produces output
- Exposes its output to downstream nodes

You can reference previous node outputs dynamically when configuring later nodes.

---

## Visual Debugging

DotPortion provides built-in debugging tools:

- Step-by-step execution logs
- Node-level input and output inspection
- Clear error messages when execution fails

This makes workflows easy to debug without adding logging code.

## Deployment Model

Workflows are deployed as **live APIs**.

- One-click deployment
- Stable endpoint URLs
- Zero infrastructure setup
- Changes require redeployment to take effect

---

## Best Practices

- Keep workflows focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer small, composable workflows
- Validate inputs early
- Handle errors explicitly
- Use versioning instead of modifying production workflows directly

---

## When to Use Multiple Workflows

Use separate workflows when:

- Endpoints have different responsibilities
- Auth rules differ
- Response formats differ
- You want independent versioning
