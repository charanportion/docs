# Secrets

**Secrets** are encrypted values used by workflows to securely connect to external systems and perform sensitive operations.

DotPortion currently supports two types of secrets:

- **MongoDB URL**
- **JWT Secret**

Secrets are managed at the **project level** and can be safely referenced inside workflow nodes without exposing sensitive data.

---

## Why Secrets Exist

Secrets allow you to:

- Keep credentials out of workflow logic
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive values
- Rotate credentials without editing workflows
- Securely share workflows within a team

All secrets are encrypted and never exposed in logs or responses.

## Supported Secret Types

### MongoDB URL

**Purpose:**\
Used to connect workflows to your MongoDB database.

This secret is required by **Database Nodes** that perform:

- Read operations
- Insert / update operations
- Aggregations and queries

#### Example MongoDB URL

```text
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
```

#### How It’s Used

1. You add the MongoDB URL as a secret
2. Database nodes reference this secret
3. DotPortion establishes a secure database connection
4. Queries are executed during workflow execution

---

### JWT Secret

**Purpose:**\
Used to **generate and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** within workflows.

This secret is required by **JWT Nodes** for:

- Token generation
- Token verification
- Authentication workflows

#### Example JWT Secret

```
your-super-secret-key
```

#### How It’s Used

- **Generate JWT:**\
  Workflow signs a token using the secret
- **Verify JWT:**\
  Incoming tokens are validated against the same secret

This ensures token authenticity and integrity.

---

## How Secrets Are Used in Workflows

Secrets are **referenced**, not exposed.

- Nodes request access to a secret
- DotPortion injects the secret securely at runtime
- Secrets are never returned in responses or logs

This keeps workflows safe even when shared.

---

## Managing Secrets

You can:

- Add new secrets
- Edit existing secrets
- Replace secret values without modifying workflows

Changes apply immediately to all workflows that reference the secret.
