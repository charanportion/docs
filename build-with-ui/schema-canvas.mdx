# Schema Canvas

The **Schema Canvas** allows you to **design database schemas visually** in DotPortion—without writing database migration code.

It provides a **GUI-based schema builder**, similar to tools like MongoDB Compass or ORM schema designers, but tightly integrated with workflows and database operations.

---

## What Is the Schema Canvas?

The Schema Canvas is a visual editor where you can:

- Select a database (Platform DB or MongoDB)
- Create and manage collections
- Define fields and their constraints
- Maintain a clear data structure for your project

Schemas created here act as the **single source of truth** for your data model.

---

## Supported Database Types

When opening the Schema Canvas, you can choose between:

### Platform Database

- Managed by DotPortion
- No external credentials required
- Best for quick setup and internal tooling

### MongoDB Database

- Connects via MongoDB URL secret
- Works with your existing MongoDB clusters
- Full compatibility with MongoDB collections

Both options provide the **same schema design experience**.

---

## Schema Canvas UI

> 🧩 **Schema Canvas (UI Reference)**

The canvas displays:

- Selected database
- List of collections
- Fields inside each collection
- Field-level configuration options

---

## Creating a Collection

To create a new collection:

1. Select the database
2. Click **Add Collection**
3. Provide a collection name
4. Start defining fields

Each collection represents a logical data entity (e.g. `users`, `orders`, `products`).

---

## Adding Fields

> 🧱 **Field Configuration Panel (UI Reference)**

Each field in a collection can be configured with the following options:

---

## Field Options Explained

### Field Name

**Purpose:**\
The key name used to store data in the document.

**Example:**

```text
email
```

Field names should be:

- Lowercase
- Descriptive
- Consistent across collections

---

### Type

**Purpose:**\
Defines the data type of the field.

**Common types include:**

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Date
- Object
- Array

The selected type helps ensure data consistency.

---

### Required

**Purpose:**\
Marks the field as mandatory.

- Enabled → field must be present
- Disabled → field is optional

This helps prevent incomplete records.

---

### Unique

**Purpose:**\
Ensures the field value is unique across the collection.

**Common use cases:**

- Email
- Username
- External IDs

This creates a uniqueness constraint at the database level.

---

### Index

**Purpose:**\
Creates an index on the field for faster queries.

Indexes improve performance for:

- Frequent lookups
- Filtering
- Sorting

⚠️ Use indexes thoughtfully to avoid unnecessary overhead.

---

### Default Value

**Purpose:**\
Sets a default value when no value is provided.

**Examples:**

```
true
```

```
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

This is useful for flags, timestamps, and status fields.

---

### Description

**Purpose:**\
Adds documentation for the field.

Descriptions help:

- Team members understand data intent
- Future maintenance
- Auto-generated docs

Descriptions do not affect runtime behavior.

---

## Visual Schema Editing Benefits

Using the Schema Canvas:

- Reduces schema errors
- Improves team collaboration
- Makes data models self-documenting
- Aligns workflows with database structure

---

## Relationship with Workflows

- Database Nodes respect schema definitions
- Field constraints guide workflow data shape
- Schema updates reflect immediately in DB operations
- Helps catch invalid data early

---

## Best Practices

- Design schemas before building workflows
- Use `required` and `unique` constraints wisely
- Add descriptions for clarity
- Index fields used in queries
- Keep schemas simple and intentional

---

## Important Notes

- Schema changes affect live data
- Existing documents are not auto-migrated
- Deleting fields does not delete data automatically
- Always test schema changes in non-production environments
