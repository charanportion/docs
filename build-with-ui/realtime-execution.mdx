# Realtime Executor

The **Realtime Executor** allows workflows in DotPortion to be executed **live**, with immediate feedback on execution status, node progress, and results.

Instead of waiting for a request to complete silently, the Realtime Executor streams execution updates as the workflow runs.

This is especially useful during **development, testing, and debugging**.

---

## What Is the Realtime Executor?

The Realtime Executor is an execution mode that:

- Runs workflows instantly
- Streams execution progress in real time
- Shows node-by-node status updates
- Surfaces errors immediately
- Returns the final response when execution completes

Think of it as **“live execution mode”** for your workflows.

---

## Why Realtime Execution Matters

Traditional APIs behave like black boxes:

- You send a request
- You wait
- You only see the final response (or error)

The Realtime Executor removes this opacity.

It allows you to:

- Understand how data flows through nodes
- See exactly where failures occur
- Debug logic without adding logs
- Iterate faster during development

---

## How Realtime Execution Works

When a workflow is executed using the Realtime Executor:

1. Execution starts at the **API Start Node**
2. Each node runs sequentially
3. As each node executes:
   - Status updates are emitted
   - Inputs and outputs are captured
4. If a node fails:
   - Execution stops immediately
   - Error details are streamed
5. When complete:
   - Final response is returned

All updates happen in **real time**.

---

## What You See During Execution

During a realtime execution, you can observe:

- Execution start event
- Node-by-node progress
- Node input and output data
- Execution errors (if any)
- Execution completion event

This provides full visibility into the workflow lifecycle.

## Realtime Executor vs Standard Execution

| Feature               | Realtime Executor | Standard Execution  |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Execution feedback    | Live              | Final response only |
| Node-level visibility | Yes               | No                  |
| Debugging             | Ideal             | Limited             |
| Production usage      | Limited           | Recommended         |

## When to Use Realtime Executor

Use the Realtime Executor when:

- Building new workflows
- Debugging logic or data issues
- Testing database or auth flows
- Validating request/response behavior

Avoid using it for:

- High-throughput production traffic
- Latency-sensitive public APIs

---

## Error Handling in Realtime Execution

If a node fails during execution:

- The error is streamed immediately
- The failing node is highlighted
- Downstream nodes are not executed
- The execution ends with a failure state

This makes troubleshooting fast and precise.

---

## Security & Isolation

- Realtime executions run in isolated environments
- Secrets are injected securely at runtime
- Sensitive values are never streamed or logged
- Execution data is visible only to authorized users

---

## Important Notes

- Realtime Executor is intended primarily for development and testing
- Execution behavior matches production execution logic
- Any side effects (database writes, external calls) still occur
- Use caution when running destructive workflows

---

## Best Practices

- Use Realtime Executor before deploying workflows
- Validate edge cases using live execution
- Avoid running destructive operations repeatedly
- Switch to standard execution for production traffic

---

## Summary

The Realtime Executor gives you **full visibility into how workflows run**.

It turns workflows from black boxes into transparent, debuggable systems—helping you build correct APIs faster and with confidence.
