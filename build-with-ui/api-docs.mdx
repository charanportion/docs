# API Docs

The **API Docs** section provides **auto-generated documentation** for all deployed workflows in your project.

It allows you to:

- View live API endpoints
- See required request parameters
- Copy ready-to-use integration code
- Inspect example responses

This makes it easy to integrate DotPortion APIs into frontend apps, backend services, and third-party tools.

---

## What Are API Docs?

API Docs are generated automatically from your **deployed workflows**.

For each deployed workflow, DotPortion creates:

- A public API endpoint
- Request schema (params, headers, body)
- Authentication requirements
- Code snippets for common languages
- Example responses

No manual documentation is required.

---

## API List View

> 🔗 **Deployed APIs (UI Reference)**

![API List Placeholder](/images/api-docs/api-list.png)

This view shows:

- Workflow name
- HTTP method
- API path
- Deployment status

Clicking an API opens its detailed documentation.

---

## API Endpoint Details

> 🌐 **API Endpoint Details (UI Reference)**

![API Endpoint Placeholder](/images/api-docs/api-endpoint.png)

Each API includes:

- **Full API URL**
- **HTTP Method**
- **Endpoint Path**

### Example

```text
POST https://api.dotportion.com/project-id/users/create
```

This is the live endpoint created from the deployed workflow.

---

## Required Parameters

> 🧾 **Request Parameters (UI Reference)**

API Docs clearly show what inputs are required.

### Supported Parameter Types

- **Path parameters**
- **Query parameters**
- **Headers**
- **Request body**

Each parameter includes:

- Name
- Type
- Required / optional status
- Description (if provided)

This data is derived from your workflow configuration.

---

## Authentication Requirements

If the workflow requires authentication, API Docs indicate:

- Auth type (e.g. API Key, JWT)
- Required headers
- Token format

This ensures consumers know exactly how to call the API.

---

## Integration Code Snippets

> 🧩 **Integration Snippets (UI Reference)**

DotPortion provides ready-to-use code snippets for common platforms.

### Example (JavaScript – Fetch)

```
fetch("https://api.dotportion.com/project-id/users/create", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com"
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Example (cURL)

```
curl -X POST \
  https://api.dotportion.com/project-id/users/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }'
```

---

## Response Examples

> 📦 **Response Preview (UI Reference)**

Each API includes a sample response generated from the workflow’s Response Node.

### Example

```
{
  "success": true,
  "userId": "64f8a21b9c1e2a001234abcd"
}
```

This helps consumers understand:

- Response structure
- Field names
- Data types
- Success and error formats

---

## Live Testing (Optional)

If enabled, API Docs may allow:

- Sending test requests
- Viewing live responses
- Validating integrations quickly

This is especially useful during development.

---

## How API Docs Stay in Sync

- Docs update automatically on redeploy
- Parameter changes reflect instantly
- Response examples follow workflow logic
- Versioned workflows generate versioned APIs

No manual updates required.

---

## Best Practices

- Always redeploy after workflow changes
- Review API Docs before sharing endpoints
- Use API Docs as the source of truth
- Share docs with frontend and integration teams

---

## Important Notes

- Only deployed workflows appear in API Docs
- Undeployed changes are not reflected
- API URLs are project-scoped
- Authentication rules apply exactly as configured

---
