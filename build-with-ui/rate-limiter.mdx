# Rate Limiter

The **Rate Limiter** helps protect your APIs from abuse, accidental overload, and traffic spikes by limiting how many requests a client can make within a given time window.

Rate limiting is configured **at the project level** and applies to all deployed workflows in the project.

---

## What Is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting enforces a rule like:

> “Allow **N requests** per **time window** from a client.”

If a client exceeds the limit, DotPortion automatically blocks further requests until the window resets.

This helps:

- Prevent abuse and DDoS-style traffic
- Protect backend resources
- Ensure fair usage across clients

## Configuration UI

> 📷 **Rate Limiter Configuration Form**

---

## Enable / Disable Rate Limiting

### Rate Limiting Toggle

- **Disabled** (default):\
  No request limits are enforced.
- **Enabled**:\
  Requests exceeding the configured limits will be rejected.

💡 Enable rate limiting for **all public APIs**.

---

## Configuration Fields

### Window (ms)

**Purpose:**\
Defines the time window (in milliseconds) during which requests are counted.

**Example:**

```text
900000
```

This equals **15 minutes**.

**Common values:**

| Window     | Milliseconds |
| :--------- | :----------- |
| 1 minute   | 60000        |
| 5 minutes  | 300000       |
| 15 minutes | 900000       |
| 1 hour     | 3600000      |

---

### Max Requests

**Purpose:**\
Defines the maximum number of requests allowed within the time window.

**Example:**

```
100
```

This allows **100 requests per 15 minutes per client**.

---

### Message

**Purpose:**\
Custom message returned when the rate limit is exceeded.

**Example:**

```
Too many requests, please try again later.
```

This message is returned with an HTTP **429 Too Many Requests** response.

---

### Standard Headers

**Purpose:**\
Enables modern, standardized rate limit headers.

When enabled, responses include headers such as:

```
RateLimit-Limit
RateLimit-Remaining
RateLimit-Reset
```

✅ Recommended for new applications.

---

### Legacy Headers

**Purpose:**\
Enables legacy `X-RateLimit-*` headers for backward compatibility.

**Example headers:**

```
X-RateLimit-Limit
X-RateLimit-Remaining
X-RateLimit-Reset
```

⚠️ Use only if required by older clients.

---

## How Rate Limiting Works in DotPortion

When enabled:

1. Each incoming request is counted per client
2. If the limit is not exceeded, the request proceeds
3. If the limit is exceeded:
   - The request is blocked
   - HTTP `429` is returned
   - Custom message is sent
4. Limits reset after the window expires

---

## Example Configurations

### Public API (Moderate Traffic)

```
Window: 900000
Max Requests: 100
Standard Headers: Enabled
```

### Internal Dashboard API

```
Window: 60000
Max Requests: 500
Standard Headers: Enabled
```

### High-Security Endpoint

```
Window: 60000
Max Requests: 20
Standard Headers: Enabled
```

---

## Best Practices

- Always enable rate limiting on public APIs
- Use smaller windows for sensitive endpoints
- Avoid extremely high limits
- Use Standard Headers for observability
- Combine rate limiting with authentication

---

## Important Notes

- Rate limits apply **across all workflows** in the project
- Changes require saving the configuration
- Misconfigured limits may block legitimate users
- Rate limiting is enforced before workflow execution
