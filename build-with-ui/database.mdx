# Database

The **Database** section in DotPortion provides a **visual interface to explore and manage your data**, similar to tools like **MongoDB Compass**.

It allows you to:

- View databases and collections
- Read documents
- Create new records
- Update existing records
- Delete records safely

This interface is designed for **development, debugging, and inspection**, and works alongside database nodes used in workflows.

---

## Supported Databases

DotPortion currently supports:

- **External MongoDB** (via MongoDB URL secret)
- **DotPortion Platform Database** (managed MongoDB)

Both are accessed through the same UI and behave consistently.

---

## Database Explorer UI

> 📁 **Database Explorer (UI Reference)**

![Database Explorer Placeholder](/images/database/database-explorer.png)

The Database Explorer lets you select:

- A database connection
- A database
- A collection

Once selected, documents are displayed in a structured, readable format.

---

## Browsing Collections

After selecting a database:

- All available **collections** are listed
- Each collection shows document count (when available)
- Clicking a collection loads its documents

This mirrors the experience of MongoDB Compass.

---

## Reading Data

> 📄 **Read Documents (UI Reference)**

![Read Documents Placeholder](/images/database/read-documents.png)

You can:

- View documents in JSON format
- Expand and collapse fields
- Scroll through records
- Inspect values for debugging

This is useful for:

- Verifying workflow outputs
- Debugging database logic
- Understanding data shape

---

## Creating Data

> ➕ **Create Document (UI Reference)**

![Create Document Placeholder](/images/database/create-document.png)

You can create new documents by:

- Selecting a collection
- Providing a valid JSON object
- Saving the document

DotPortion validates the input before inserting the record.

---

## Updating Data

> ✏️ **Update Document (UI Reference)**

![Update Document Placeholder](/images/database/update-document.png)

You can update documents by:

- Editing existing fields
- Adding new fields
- Modifying nested values

Changes are applied immediately after confirmation.

---

## Deleting Data

> 🗑️ **Delete Document (UI Reference)**

![Delete Document Placeholder](/images/database/delete-document.png)

You can delete:

- Individual documents
- Selected records (where supported)

⚠️ Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.

## Platform Database vs External MongoDB

| Feature       | Platform Database | External MongoDB            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Setup         | No setup required | Requires MongoDB URL secret |
| Management    | Fully managed     | User-managed                |
| Access        | Project-scoped    | External cluster            |
| UI Experience | Same              | Same                        |

---

## How This Relates to Workflows

- Database UI is for **manual inspection and management**
- Database Nodes are for **runtime execution**
- Both use the **same underlying data**
- Changes made in UI affect workflows immediately

---

## Security & Permissions

- Database access is project-scoped
- Secrets are required for external databases
- Only authorized users can modify data
- Credentials are never exposed

---

## Best Practices

- Use UI for debugging and inspection
- Avoid frequent destructive changes in production
- Prefer workflows for automated operations
- Validate data shapes before inserting records
- Use separate databases for dev and prod

---

## Important Notes

- UI actions directly modify the database
- There is no automatic rollback
- Large collections may be paginated
- Performance depends on database size and indexes

---

## Summary

| Action           | Supported |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| View collections | Yes       |
| Read documents   | Yes       |
| Create documents | Yes       |
| Update documents | Yes       |
| Delete documents | Yes       |

The Database interface gives you **full visibility and control over your data**, without leaving DotPortion.
