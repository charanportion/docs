# Logs & Observability

DotPortion provides **built-in observability** for workflows, so you can understand **what happened**, **where it happened**, and **why it happened**—without adding manual logging.

Logs are designed to give **clear visibility at every level of execution**, from high-level trends to node-by-node details.

---

## What Are Logs in DotPortion?

Logs capture **execution data** whenever a workflow runs.

They help you:
- Debug failed executions
- Inspect data flow between nodes
- Monitor performance and usage
- Observe workflows in real time

DotPortion logs are available in three main views:
1. **Execution Charts**
2. **Node-Level Logs**
3. **Live Logs (Realtime Execution)**

---

## Execution Charts

Execution charts provide a **high-level overview** of workflow activity over time.

> 📊 **Execution Charts (UI Reference)**

### What Charts Show

Charts typically display:
- Number of executions
- Success vs failure rate
- Execution trends over time
- Error frequency

This view is useful for:
- Monitoring API health
- Spotting spikes or drops in traffic
- Identifying unstable workflows

---

## Node-Level Logs

Node-level logs show **exactly what happened inside each node** during a workflow execution.

> 🧩 **Node-Level Logs (UI Reference)**

### What You Can See

For each node execution:
- Node name and type
- Execution status (success / failure)
- Input data received by the node
- Output data produced by the node
- Error details (if any)
- Execution duration

This makes debugging precise and fast.

---

### Example Use Case

If a workflow fails:
1. Open the failed execution
2. Inspect nodes one by one
3. Identify the node where execution stopped
4. Review inputs and outputs
5. Fix logic or configuration

No guesswork required.

---

## Live Logs (Realtime Execution)

Live logs stream execution events **as the workflow runs**, node by node.

### When Live Logs Are Used

Live logs are available when using:
- Realtime Executor
- Manual workflow testing
- Development and debugging sessions

They allow you to:
- Watch nodes execute in sequence
- See inputs and outputs instantly
- Catch failures the moment they occur

This turns workflows into **transparent, observable systems** instead of black boxes.

---

## Execution States

Each execution can be in one of the following states:

| State | Description |
|-----|------------|
| Running | Workflow is currently executing |
| Success | Execution completed successfully |
| Failed | Execution stopped due to an error |

These states are reflected consistently across charts, logs, and live views.

---

## Security & Data Safety

- Secrets are **never shown** in logs
- Sensitive values are masked
- Logs are visible only to authorized users
- Logs are stored securely for debugging purposes

---

## Best Practices

- Use execution charts for monitoring
- Use node-level logs for debugging
- Use live logs during development
- Avoid logging sensitive data in logic nodes
- Review logs before deploying changes

---

## Important Notes

- Logs reflect real execution behavior
- Side effects (DB writes, external calls) are logged but not replayed
- Logs are tied to workflow versions
- Old executions remain traceable after updates

---

## Summary

| Feature | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Execution Charts | High-level monitoring |
| Node-Level Logs | Detailed debugging |
| Live Logs | Real-time visibility |

Logs give you **confidence and control** when building and running APIs in DotPortion.
