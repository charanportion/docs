## Why DotPortion?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Visual Workflow Builder" icon="share-nodes">
    Build complex backend flows as visual graphs: drag, drop, connect. Branching, conditions, loops, retries — all modeled as nodes you can understand at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No-Code & Low-Code Together" icon="code">
    Start with no-code nodes for common tasks, then drop into TypeScript/JavaScript whenever you need full control. Every node’s code is visible and tweakable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API-first by Design" icon="server">
    Create secure, scalable APIs and webhooks in minutes. Perfect for powering frontends built with Next.js, React, FlutterFlow, Webflow, Framer, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-Native Platform" icon="robot">
    Orchestrate AI agents, tool calls, RAG pipelines, and multi-step reasoning flows. Let AI generate nodes, wire integrations, and even propose full workflows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Serverless & Scalable" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Built on modern cloud infrastructure with autoscaling, background jobs, queues, and scheduled tasks — so you never have to touch DevOps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built for Teams & Products" icon="users-gear">
    Projects, environments, secrets management, role-based access, version control, and deployment workflows that match how real teams ship real products.

## How do you want to build?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Build Visually">
    ### The Visual Workflow Builder

    DotPortion is centered around a **visual canvas** where each node represents a step in your backend logic — API call, DB query, condition, loop, AI action, transformation, and more.

    <Card title="Canvas View" icon="diagram-project">
      <br />

      <Frame caption="Perfect for visual thinkers — see your entire backend as a living flow instead of scattered scripts.">
        {/* You can replace this with a real screenshot later */}

        ![DotPortion Visual Canvas](/assets/dotportion/canvas-preview.png)
      </Frame>
      The **Canvas View** lets you design workflows like a story: connect triggers, add logic, branch flows, and inspect data as it moves between nodes — all in one unified view.
    </Card>
    <br />

    <Card title="Node-based Logic" icon="layer-group">
      <br />

      Use purpose-built node types for:

      - Parameters & validation
      - Logic & branching
      - Database reads/writes
      - Auth & JWT handling
      - External API calls
      - AI model calls & tools
      - Responses, queues, and background jobs

      Each node is configurable via a friendly UI, but still backed by real code for advanced scenarios.
    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build with Code">
    ### Bring Your Own JavaScript / TypeScript

    Prefer code? DotPortion gives you a **first-class coding experience** inside each workflow.

    <Card title="Code Nodes" icon="terminal">
      Add **Code Nodes** wherever you need custom logic: transform payloads, implement edge cases, or wire niche integrations.

      - Write in JavaScript or TypeScript
      - Use 1M+ NPM packages
      - Access workflow context, environment variables, and secrets
      - Log, debug, and inspect execution easily
    </Card>
    <Card title="Version Control & Environments" icon="git-branch">
      DotPortion comes with built-in versioning for workflows:

      - Track changes over time
      - Tag versions (e.g. `v1`, `staging`, `production`)
      - Roll back if something breaks
      - Promote workflows across environments safely
    </Card>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build with AI">
    ### Build without starting from scratch

    DotPortion is designed to **collaborate with AI**, not just call it.

    <Card title="AI Workflow Assistant" icon="comments">
      Describe your use case in natural language:

      - “Create a user signup API with email verification”
      - “Build a Stripe subscription flow with webhooks”
      - “Set up a workflow that triggers when a row is created and sends a Slack alert”

      The AI assistant can propose a workflow, wire the nodes, and generate code where needed — you keep full control to review and tweak.
    </Card>
    <Card title="AI-Generated Nodes" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
      If an integration or node doesn’t exist yet, just **ask AI**:

      - “Build a node that calls this custom REST API and normalizes the response”
      - “Generate a node that uses this NPM package to process images”

      DotPortion turns your description into a reusable node you can edit, reuse, and share.

## DotPortion FAQ

export function FAQBox({ title, children }) {
  return (
    <details open className="last-of-type:mb-0 rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2 mt-4">
      <summary>
        <strong className="text-lg">{title}</strong>
      </summary>
      <div className="nx-p-2">{children}</div>
    </details>
  );
}

<FAQBox title="Is DotPortion no-code or low-code?">
  DotPortion is **both**. You can build entire workflows using only visual nodes,
  but every node can also be opened and edited in JavaScript/TypeScript when you need
  more control. That means you never get “stuck” behind a no-code limitation.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What kind of projects is DotPortion good for?">
  Anything that needs a backend: SaaS applications, internal tools, AI automations,
  background tasks, integrations between services, and more. If you’re wiring APIs,
  databases, and AI together, DotPortion is a strong fit.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use DotPortion with my existing frontend stack?">
  Yes. DotPortion is **frontend-agnostic**. Use it with Next.js, React, Vue, Flutter,
  mobile apps, or no-code builders like Webflow, Framer, FlutterFlow, Bubble, and others.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Do I need to manage servers?">
  No. DotPortion runs on a **serverless architecture**. You focus on workflows and logic;
  we handle deployment, scaling, and infrastructure.
</FAQBox>
