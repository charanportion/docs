# What is DotPortion?

DotPortion is a **visual, no‑code API builder** that lets you design, deploy, and manage backend APIs using a node‑based workflow, without writing traditional server code.

Instead of writing controllers, routes, and services, you **connect nodes** that define:

- how an API is triggered
- how data flows
- how logic is applied
- how responses are returned

DotPortion handles infrastructure, execution, and deployment for you.

# Who is DotPortion for?

DotPortion is built for:

- **Founders** who want to ship backend APIs fast
- **Frontend developers** who don’t want to manage backend complexity
- **No‑code / low‑code builders** creating internal tools or SaaS MVPs
- **Teams** who want versioned, auditable, visual backend logic

If you’ve ever struggled with backend setup, scaling, or maintenance — DotPortion is designed for you.

# What can you build with DotPortion?

With DotPortion, you can build:

- REST APIs
- CRUD backends
- Authentication flows (JWT‑based)
- Database‑connected endpoints
- Webhook receivers
- Workflow automations
- API proxies to third‑party services

All of this is done visually using nodes.

# How DotPortion works

DotPortion is built around **workflows**.

A workflow is:

- a sequence of connected nodes
- executed from top to bottom
- where data flows between nodes

Each node performs **one clear responsibility**.

Think of a workflow like a pipeline:

`Request → Parameters → Logic → Database → Response`

Once deployed, every workflow becomes a **live API endpoint**.

# Core Building Blocks

## Workflow

A workflow represents a complete backend API.

## Node

A node is a single operation inside a workflow.

### Examples:

- API Trigger Node
- Parameters Node
- Logic Node
- Database Node
- Response Node

## Execution Context

Each node receives data from previous nodes and can modify or extend it.

# Why DotPortion?

Traditional backend development requires:

- writing boilerplate code
- managing infrastructure
- handling deployments
- debugging runtime issues

DotPortion abstracts all of this.

You focus only on **what your API should do**, DotPortion handles the rest.
