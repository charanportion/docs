# JWT Verify Node

The **JWT Verify Node** is used to **validate and decode a JSON Web Token (JWT)** inside a DotPortion workflow.

It allows you to **protect APIs**, verify client identity, and safely access token claims before executing sensitive logic.

This node is typically used **after the API Start Node** and before any protected operations.

---

## What the JWT Verify Node Does

The JWT Verify Node is responsible for:

- Verifying the JWT signature
- Ensuring the token has not expired
- Decoding the JWT payload
- Rejecting invalid or tampered tokens

It works like `jsonwebtoken.verify()` in traditional backend systems.

## Configuration Fields

### Secret

The **Secret** defines which secret key is used to verify the token.

Currently supported option:

- **JWT** – Uses the platform-managed JWT secret

> 🔐 DotPortion securely manages this secret.\
> You don’t need to store or handle secret keys manually.

---

## How Token Verification Works

When this node executes:

1. The incoming JWT is read (typically from headers)
2. The token signature is verified using the selected secret
3. Token expiration (`exp`) is checked
4. If valid, the decoded payload is exposed to downstream nodes
5. If invalid, workflow execution stops with an error

---

## Input Token Source

The JWT is usually provided via the **Authorization header**:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

You can extract this header using the **Request Parameters Node** before verification.

---

## Output

If verification succeeds, the node outputs the **decoded JWT payload**.

Example output:

```
{
  "userId": "123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "iat": 1710000000,
  "exp": 1710003600
}
```

This data can be used by:

- Condition Node
- Logic Node
- Database Node
- API Response Node

## Example: Protect an API

### Workflow Order

1. API Start Node
2. Request Parameters Node (extract `Authorization` header)
3. JWT Verify Node
4. Condition / Logic / Database
5. API Response Node
