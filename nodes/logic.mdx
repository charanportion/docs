# Logic Node

The **Logic Node** allows you to write **custom JavaScript or TypeScript code** to process, transform, and compute data inside a DotPortion workflow.

It gives you full flexibility when visual configuration is not enough, while still keeping execution secure and isolated.

---

## What the Logic Node Does

The Logic Node is responsible for:

- Transforming incoming data
- Performing calculations
- Restructuring objects
- Combining data from multiple nodes
- Preparing data for database or response nodes

It works like a **server-side function** that runs during workflow execution.

## Configuration

### Code

The **Code** field accepts **JavaScript or TypeScript**.

You can reference outputs from previous nodes using **dynamic values**.

> Tip: Type `{{` to insert dynamic values from earlier nodes.

---

## Writing Logic Code

Your code runs in a **secure sandboxed environment**.

You can:

- Declare variables
- Perform calculations
- Create objects and arrays
- Return a value

### Example: Transform input data

```ts
const title = {{parameters.title}};
const description = {{parameters.description}};

return {
  title: title.trim(),
  description: description.trim(),
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

## Using Dynamic Values

Dynamic values are injected using the `{{ }}` syntax.

They can come from:

- Request Parameters Node
- Condition Node
- Database Node
- JWT Node

Example:

```typescript
const userId = {{params.userId}};
```

---

## Returning Data

The **return value** of the Logic Node becomes its output.

This output is available to all downstream nodes.

### Example return value

```typescript
{
  "total": 1200,
  "discountApplied": true
}
```

---

## Execution Rules

- Code must return a value
- Execution is synchronous
- Errors thrown will stop workflow execution
- Only supported JavaScript/TypeScript features are allowed

---

## Common Use Cases

- Data normalization
- Aggregations
- Conditional transformations
- Building response objects
- Preparing database payloads

---

## Error Handling

If your code:

- Throws an error
- Returns `undefined`

The workflow fails and an error response is returned.
