# MongoDB Node

The **MongoDB Node** allows you to **interact with MongoDB collections** directly inside a DotPortion workflow.

You can perform database operations such as inserting, querying, updating, and deleting documents without writing backend code.

---

## Before You Start (Important)

Before using the MongoDB Node, you must **configure your MongoDB connection**.

### Step 1: Add MongoDB Connection URL

1. Go to **Secrets** in the DotPortion dashboard
2. Add your **MongoDB connection URL**
3. Save the secret

### Step 2: Allow Network Access

In your MongoDB provider (e.g. MongoDB Atlas):

- Enable **Network Access**
- Allow connections from **all IP addresses** (`0.0.0.0/0`)

> ⚠️ This is required so DotPortion servers can access your database.

---

## What the MongoDB Node Does

The MongoDB Node is responsible for:

- Connecting to a configured MongoDB database
- Performing CRUD operations on collections
- Mapping workflow data to database fields
- Returning database results to the workflow

It works similarly to MongoDB drivers used in traditional backend applications.

## Configuration Fields

### Select Collection

Choose the MongoDB collection you want to operate on.

You can manage collections using **Manage Collections**.

---

### Operation

Select the database operation to perform.

Supported operations include:

- Insert One
- Find One
- Find Many
- Update One
- Delete One

---

### Available Fields

This section shows the schema fields available in the selected collection, including:

- Field name
- Data type
- Required fields

This helps ensure correct data mapping.

---

### Query Fields

Query Fields define **how documents are matched**.

Used for:

- Finding documents
- Updating specific records
- Deleting records

Example:

```typescript
_id = ObjectId value
```

### Data Fields

Data Fields define **what data is written or updated** in the document.

You can insert dynamic values using `{{ }}`.

Example:

```typescript
{{requestparameters.title}}
```

---

## Example: Insert a Todo

### Configuration

**Collection:** `Todo`\
**Operation:** `Insert One`

**Data Fields**

- `title` → `{{requestparameters.title}}`
- `description` → `{{requestparameters.description}}`
- `isCompleted` → `{{requestparameters.isCompleted}}`

---

## Output

The MongoDB Node outputs the result of the operation.

Example output:

```typescript
{
  "insertedId": "64fa2c9d8e..."
}
```

This output is available to downstream nodes.

## Execution Rules

- MongoDB connection must be configured in Secrets
- Required fields must be provided
- Query fields must match document schema
- Errors stop workflow execution
