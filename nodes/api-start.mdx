# API Start Node

The **API Start Node** is the **entry point** of every workflow in DotPortion.

It defines **how an external HTTP request triggers your workflow**, similar to how routes work in traditional backend frameworks like Express, FastAPI, or Rails.

Every workflow must start with **exactly one API Start Node**.

---

## What the API Start Node Does

The API Start Node is responsible for:

- Defining the **HTTP method** your API accepts
- Defining the **URL path** for the endpoint
- Receiving incoming request data:
  - Request body
  - Query parameters
  - Path parameters
  - Headers
- Triggering workflow execution

Once a request matches the configured **method + path**, DotPortion begins executing the connected nodes **from top to bottom**.

## Configuration Fields

### Method

The **HTTP method** defines how clients interact with your API.

Supported methods:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`

Choose the method based on what your API does.

**Common usage patterns:**

| Method | Use case              |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| GET    | Fetch data            |
| POST   | Create new data       |
| PUT    | Replace existing data |
| PATCH  | Update partial data   |
| DELETE | Remove data           |

---

### Path

The **Path** defines the URL route where this API is exposed.

This is the **unique identifier** of your endpoint within the project.

#### Example

```text
POST /create
```

When deployed, the full API URL becomes:

```
https://api.dotportion.com/api/{tenant-name}/{project-id}/create
```
