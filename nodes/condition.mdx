# Condition Node

The **Condition Node** allows you to control **whether a workflow continues execution** based on a condition written as a **JavaScript expression**.

It enables **branching logic** similar to `if` statements in traditional programming.

---

## What the Condition Node Does

The Condition Node is responsible for:

- Evaluating a JavaScript expression
- Deciding whether the workflow should continue
- Enabling conditional execution paths

If the condition evaluates to **true**, execution continues to the next connected node.\
If it evaluates to **false**, the workflow stops or follows an alternate path (if configured).

## Configuration

### Condition

The **Condition** field accepts a **JavaScript expression** that must evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

You can reference data from previous nodes using **dynamic values**.

> Tip: Type `{{` to insert values from earlier nodes.

---

## Writing Conditions

Conditions are written as **pure JavaScript expressions**.

### Examples

#### Check a boolean value

```js
{{parameters.isCompleted}} === true
```

#### Check if a value exists

```javascript
{{parameters.title}} != null
```

#### Compare numbers

```javascript
{{order.total}} > 1000
```

#### String comparison

```javascript
{{user.role}} === "admin"
```

## Using Dynamic Values

Dynamic values come from:

- Request Parameters Node
- Logic Node
- Database Node
- JWT Node

They are injected using the `{{ }}` syntax.

Example:

```javascript
{{params.userId}} !== undefined
```

---

## Execution Behavior

- Condition is evaluated at runtime
- Expression must return `true` or `false`
- If `true` → workflow continues
- If `false` → workflow stops or exits the current branch

---

## Common Use Cases

- Input validation
- Role-based access control
- Conditional database writes
- Feature flags
- Guard clauses (fail fast)

---

## Example: Validate Required Input

```javascript
{{parameters.title}} && {{parameters.description}}
```

Only continues execution if both values are present.

---

## Error Handling

If the condition:

- Throws an error
- Returns a non-boolean value

The workflow fails and an error response is returned.
