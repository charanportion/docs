# Database Node

The **Database Node** allows you to **store, query, update, and delete data** using **DotPortion’s in-house managed database**.

This node provides the same workflow-driven database experience as the MongoDB Node, but **without requiring any external database setup**.

DotPortion automatically handles:

- Database provisioning
- Connection management
- Security and scaling

---

## Before You Start

No external configuration is required.

The Database Node uses **DotPortion’s built-in MongoDB-based platform database**, which is automatically available for every project.

You can start using it immediately.

---

## What the Database Node Does

The Database Node is responsible for:

- Performing CRUD operations on in-house collections
- Managing data persistence per project
- Mapping workflow data to database fields
- Returning query results to the workflow

It behaves similarly to the MongoDB Node but is **fully managed by DotPortion**.

## Configuration Fields

### Select Collection

Choose the collection you want to operate on.

Collections are scoped to your project.

You can manage collections using **Manage Collections**.

---

### Operation

Select the database operation to perform.

Supported operations include:

- Insert One
- Find One
- Find Many
- Update One
- Delete One

---

### Available Fields

Displays the schema fields for the selected collection, including:

- Field name
- Data type
- Required fields

This helps ensure correct data mapping and prevents invalid writes.

---

### Query Fields

Query Fields define **how records are matched**.

Used for:

- Finding records
- Updating specific documents
- Deleting records

Example:

```typescript
_id = ObjectId value
```

### Data Fields

Data Fields define **what data is written or updated**.

Dynamic values from previous nodes can be inserted using `{{ }}`.

Example:

```typescript
{{requestparameters.title}}
```

---

## Example: Insert a Todo

### Configuration

**Collection:** `Todo`\
**Operation:** `Insert One`

**Data Fields**

- `title` → `{{requestparameters.title}}`
- `description` → `{{requestparameters.description}}`
- `isCompleted` → `{{requestparameters.isCompleted}}`

---

## Output

The Database Node outputs the result of the operation.

Example output:

```typescript
{
  "insertedId": "65a12bc9e4..."
}
```

This output is available to downstream nodes such as:

- Logic Node
- Loop Node
- API Response Node

---

## Execution Rules

- No external database configuration required
- Required fields must be provided
- Query conditions must match schema
- Errors stop workflow execution
