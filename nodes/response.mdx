# API Response Node

The **API Response Node** is responsible for sending the **final HTTP response** back to the client.

It marks the **end of workflow execution**.\
Once this node runs, no further nodes are executed.

Every workflow that exposes an API **must end with exactly one API Response Node**.

---

## What the API Response Node Does

The API Response Node is responsible for:

- Defining the **HTTP status code**
- Sending the final response to the client
- Ending workflow execution

It acts like a `res.send()` or `return Response()` in traditional backend frameworks.

## Configuration Fields

### Status

The **Status** field defines the HTTP status code returned to the client.

You can select from standard HTTP response codes.

#### Common Status Codes

| Status Code               | Meaning                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 200 OK                    | Request successful            |
| 201 Created               | Resource created              |
| 204 No Content            | Success with no response body |
| 400 Bad Request           | Client-side error             |
| 401 Unauthorized          | Authentication required       |
| 403 Forbidden             | Access denied                 |
| 404 Not Found             | Resource not found            |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Server error                  |

## How Response Data Works

The API Response Node sends the **final output** of the workflow.

The response body is typically constructed using:

- Data from previous nodes
- Logic or transformations
- Database query results

Once this node executes:

- The response is returned to the client
- Workflow execution stops immediately

## Example: Success Response

### Configuration

```text
Status: 200 OK
```

### Response Body

```
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User created successfully"
}
```

## Example: Error Response

### Configuration

```
Status: 400 Bad Request
```

### Response Body

```
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid input data"
}
```
