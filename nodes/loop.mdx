# Loop Node

The **Loop Node** allows you to **iterate over a list of items** and execute connected nodes **once for each item**.

It enables repetitive operations such as processing arrays, bulk database actions, or applying logic to multiple records — similar to a `for` or `forEach` loop in traditional programming.

---

## What the Loop Node Does

The Loop Node is responsible for:

- Iterating over an array or list of items
- Executing downstream nodes for each item
- Exposing the **current item** to child nodes
- Controlling repeated workflow execution

Each iteration runs **sequentially**, ensuring predictable execution.

## Configuration

### Items

The **Items** field defines the list you want to loop through.

It must resolve to an **array**.

You can:

- Write a JavaScript expression
- Reference dynamic values from previous nodes

> Tip: Type `{{` to insert dynamic node values.

---

## Providing Items to Loop Over

### Example: Loop over request body array

```js
{{parameters.items}}
```

Request body:

```typescript
{
  "items": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Task A" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Task B" }
  ]
}
```

---

### Example: Loop over database results

```typescript
{{database.results}}
```

---

## Loop Execution Behavior

- The Loop Node runs once per item in the array
- During each iteration:
  - The **current item** is available to downstream nodes
  - Connected nodes execute in order
- After all items are processed, execution continues after the loop

---

## Accessing the Current Item

Inside the loop, the current item is available as:

```typescript
{{item}}
```

Example usage in a Logic Node:

```typescript
const current = {{item}};
return {
  id: current.id,
  processedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

---

## Common Use Cases

- Bulk database inserts or updates
- Processing lists from request payloads
- Sending notifications for multiple users
- Transforming arrays of objects
- Applying validation per item

---

## Execution Rules

- Items must resolve to an array
- Empty arrays result in zero iterations
- Errors inside the loop stop execution immediately
- Loop execution is sequential, not parallel

---

## Common Mistakes

- Passing a non-array value to Items
- Forgetting to return data inside loop logic
- Assuming parallel execution
- Mutating shared state across iterations

---

## Best Practices

- Validate input before looping
- Keep logic inside loops lightweight
- Use loops only when necessary
- Prefer database bulk operations when supported
- Handle errors explicitly inside the loop

---

## Example: Bulk Create Tasks

**Items**

```typescript
{{parameters.tasks}}
```

**Request Body**

```typescript
{
  "tasks": [
    { "title": "Task 1" },
    { "title": "Task 2" }
  ]
}
```

Each task is processed one by one by downstream nodes.
