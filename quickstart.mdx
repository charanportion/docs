# Quick Start

This guide walks you through creating and deploying your **first API** using DotPortion, from project setup to testing a live endpoint.

By the end, you’ll have a working API you can call from any client.

---

## Step 1: Create a Project

A **project** is the top-level container for your APIs, workflows, and configurations.

1. Go to the **Projects** dashboard
2. Click **Create Project**
3. Enter:
   - **Project Name** – A short, meaningful name
   - **Description** – What this project is used for

Once created, all workflows and APIs will live inside this project.

---

## Step 2: Create a Workflow

A **workflow** defines how an API request is processed.

1. Inside your project, click **Create Workflow**
2. Enter:
   - **Workflow Name** – Example: `Create User API`
   - **Description** – What this workflow does
   - **Method** – Choose an HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.)
   - **Path** – Define the API route
     - Do **not** start the path with / 

After creation, you’ll be taken to the workflow builder.

#### Example

```text
Method: POST
Path: users/create
```

This will create an endpoint like:

```
POST https://api.dotportion.com/api/{tenent-name}/{project-id}/users/create
```

> Tip: DotPortion automatically handles routing, you only define the method and path.

---

## Step 4: Test the Workflow

Before deploying, you can test your API directly from DotPortion.

1. Open the **Test Panel** inside the workflow editor
2. Provide:
   - Request body
   - Query parameters (if any)
   - Headers (if required)
3. Click **Run**

You’ll see:

- Node-by-node execution
- Request and response data
- Errors (if any)

This helps you validate logic before making the API public.

---

## Step 5: Deploy the Workflow

Once you’re happy with the result, deploy your API.

1. Go to the **Workflows Table**
2. Find your workflow
3. Toggle the **Deploy** switch to ON

When deployment is enabled:

- The API becomes publicly accessible
- DotPortion hosts and manages the endpoint

You can toggle deployment OFF anytime to disable the API.

---

## Step 6: Get Your API Endpoint

To find your API URL:

1. Open **API Docs** for your project
2. Copy the generated endpoint URL

This URL is what you’ll use in:

- Frontend apps
- Mobile apps
- Backend services
- API clients like Postman or curl
