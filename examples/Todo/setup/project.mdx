# Todo Project

Create a new project to contain everything related to the Todo application.

---

## Project Name

```text
todo-app
```

This project represents the backend for a simple Todo application.

---

## What Lives Inside This Project

- Todo workflows (APIs)
- Database schema
- Secrets
- Logs and API Docs

---

## Why One Project?

Using a single project ensures:

- All APIs share the same database
- Security rules apply consistently
- Logs and execution history stay together

---

Once the project is created, the next step is defining the **database schema**.
