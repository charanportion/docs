# Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is DotPortion, and who is it for?">
    DotPortion is a **no-code API builder and workflow orchestration platform** that lets you design, test, version, and deploy APIs visually using nodes.

    It’s built for:

    - Startup founders
    - Backend & full-stack developers
    - Internal tooling teams
    - Product teams building APIs without boilerplate
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does DotPortion differ from tools like Postman, n8n, or backend frameworks?">
    DotPortion is **not just an API client or automation tool**.

    - Unlike Postman, DotPortion **creates and hosts APIs**
    - Unlike traditional frameworks, you **don’t write boilerplate code**
    - Unlike automation tools, workflows are **request-driven APIs**, not cron jobs

    You visually define:

    - Request parameters
    - Business logic
    - Database operations
    - Authentication
    - Response formatting
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a workflow in DotPortion?">
    A workflow is a **visual execution graph** that represents how an API request is processed.

    Each workflow:

    - Starts with an API trigger
    - Passes data through connected nodes
    - Executes nodes sequentially or conditionally
    - Returns a structured HTTP response
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are nodes, and how do they work?">
    Nodes are the **building blocks** of a workflow.\
    Each node performs a single responsibility, such as:

    - Reading request parameters
    - Running logic or conditions
    - Querying a database
    - Generating JWTs
    - Formatting responses

    Data flows between nodes automatically based on connections.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I write custom logic or code inside DotPortion?">
    Yes. DotPortion supports **custom logic nodes** where you can write controlled JavaScript logic.

    - Runs in a secure sandbox
    - No access to the underlying system
    - Ideal for transformations, validations, and calculations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How is data passed between nodes?">
    Each node receives input from:

    - The request
    - Previous nodes’ outputs

    Outputs are available as structured JSON and can be referenced dynamically in downstream nodes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does DotPortion support databases?">
    Yes. DotPortion supports database nodes with:

    - Secure credential management
    - Dynamic queries
    - Read & write operations

    Supported databases may vary by plan and region.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does authentication work?">
    DotPortion supports authentication via:

    - API keys
    - JWT generation & validation
    - Custom auth logic using nodes

    Authentication can be enforced per workflow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is version control supported?">
    Yes. DotPortion includes **workflow versioning**, allowing you to:

    - Track changes
    - Roll back to previous versions
    - Maintain staging and production flows
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are workflows deployed?">
    Once a workflow is ready:

    - You deploy it with a single click
    - DotPortion provisions and hosts the API
    - Each deployment gets a stable endpoint
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if a workflow fails during execution?">
    If a node fails:

    - Execution stops immediately
    - Errors are logged with node-level details
    - You can inspect inputs, outputs, and failure reasons
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I debug workflows?">
    DotPortion provides:

    - Step-by-step execution logs
    - Node-level input/output inspection
    - Error tracing for failed executions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is user data stored or used for training AI models?">
    No.

    - API request data is **not used for training**
    - Execution data is retained only for debugging and logs
    - Credentials are securely encrypted
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where is DotPortion hosted?">
    DotPortion infrastructure is hosted on **secure cloud providers** with industry-standard practices for availability, isolation, and encryption.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there rate limits?">
    Yes. Rate limits depend on your plan and usage tier.

    Limits help ensure platform stability and fair usage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I report bugs or issues?">
    If you find a bug:

    - Share details in the community
    - Include workflow screenshots or JSON
    - Mention the node where it occurred

    Our team actively monitors reports.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I request new features or nodes?">
    We actively build based on user feedback.

    Feature requests can include:

    - New nodes
    - Integrations
    - Execution improvements
    - UI/UX enhancements

    Share your ideas in the community.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does DotPortion guarantee uptime or SLAs?">
    During beta, we do not provide formal SLAs.

    Stability and reliability are top priorities, and uptime guarantees may be introduced in enterprise plans.
