# Feature Roadmap

This roadmap outlines where DotPortion is headed.  
Our focus is on **developer leverage**, **safe iteration**, and **AI-native API building**.

> Timelines may evolve as we learn from real usage, but our direction remains consistent.

---

## Now — Beta v1.0 (Live)

**Available today:**

- Visual API workflow builder
- Core nodes (Request, Logic, Database, Response)
- Deterministic workflow execution engine
- Basic workflow version history
- One-click API deployment with hosted endpoints

---

## Next — v1.1 (Short Term)

### AI-Assisted Workflow Builder (Foundational)

AI acts as a **co-builder**, not a black box.

**Planned capabilities:**
- Describe an API in natural language
- Auto-suggest required nodes and connections
- Generate parameter schemas
- Insert logic with safe defaults
- Explain workflows in plain English

**Goal:**  
Reduce time from idea → working API from hours to minutes.

---

### Improved Workflow Versioning

Move beyond simple history into **intentional iteration**.

**Planned improvements:**
- Named versions (`v1`, `v2`, `staging`)
- Version notes and change summaries
- Visual comparison between versions
- Instant rollback to any previous version

---

## Near Term — v1.2

### Workflow Branching (Git-like Model)

Bring software-grade branching to no-code APIs.

**Planned features:**
- Create branches from any workflow version
- Parallel development (feature, staging, production)
- Independent testing per branch
- Merge branches back into main workflows
- Conflict detection at node and connection level

**Example use cases:**
- Test new logic without impacting production
- Run A/B versions of APIs
- Maintain client-specific behavior

---

### AI-Driven Workflow Editing

AI that **modifies existing workflows safely**.

**Planned capabilities:**
- “Add authentication to this workflow”
- “Optimize this API for performance”
- “Convert this workflow to async execution”
- Clear explanation of every AI-made change

---

## Mid Term — v2.0

### Autonomous Workflow Construction (Opt-in)

AI that can **plan, build, test, and prepare deployments** — with human approval.

**Planned flow:**
1. User describes the product or API
2. AI plans required endpoints
3. Builds workflows node-by-node
4. Runs test executions
5. Requests approval before deployment

**Safety-first by design:**
- No silent deployments
- Full visibility into AI decisions
- Manual override at every step

---

### Advanced Version Control

**Planned features:**
- Environment-aware versions (dev / staging / prod)
- Version tagging and releases
- Rollbacks with execution history
- Traffic-safe version switching

---

## Long Term — Platform Vision

### Workflow as Infrastructure

DotPortion workflows become **infrastructure primitives**.

**Future directions:**
- Reusable workflow templates
- Organization-wide workflow libraries
- Fine-grained permissions
- Workflow sharing & marketplace
- Observability and performance analytics

---

## Guiding Principles

- Visual first, not magic
- AI assists, humans approve
- Safe iteration over shortcuts
- Production readiness over demos
